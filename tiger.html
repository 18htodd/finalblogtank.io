        <h2>Design and Description</h2>
        <p>The original design of the Tiger began in 1936 and 1937, but the rapid implimentation of factors learned after the fighting in Russia began greatly increased the rate at which the vehicle was developed. Essentially, the vehicle was born from the development of multiple other projects, all of which led to the design of the tiger being the way it is. The gun and armor were truly decided upon when the Wehrmacht met the USSR and their T-34's and KV-1's. The majority of the German tanks could not deal or handle with the Russian tanks. When the Tiger was introduced, the long 88mm cannon and heavy armor was more than a match for the Russian tanks. At this point, the arms race between the two nations had begun. The video above is an example of the sole remaining and running Tiger tank. Tiger 131 --located in the UK---. Among people who love AFV's, this is really famous vehicle.   </p>

            <h2>Tiger in Action and 1/35 Tigers</h2>
            <p>Like stated above, the armor and weapon on the Tiger were more than enough to handle anything thrown at it in 1942. The 88mm could hit targets at 4,000 meters at 50% acuracy. Sherman tanks could maybe hit a tiger at this distance, but the Sherman gun was never meant for such distances, much less penetrating the armor of a Tiger. Subsequent trials with a captured tank in British hands saw that shot groupings at 1200 meeters were all within a 16'' by 18'' square. The first tigers saw combat on the eastern front in August 1942. However they were poorly used, and despite their armor and armament, their mechanical problems, along with the terrible weather, led to the destruction of all the initial tanks sent. It was during the Soviet 1943 Offensive that the impact of the Tiger was truly felt when, despite operating not more than seven Tigers in the field at any time, they are credited with nearly a quarter of all Soviet tank losses, hardly surprising as the Soviet 76mm F-34 tank gun was unable to pierce even the side or rear armor on the Tiger. The first large scale combat action for the Tiger I took place in July 1943, during Operation Citadel at Kursk, when 146 Tigers were used. The tank would then be used in every other theater of the war, including North Africa and even the defense of Berlin, with some photos showing a few tigers in areas we would have walked during our time in the city. </p>

            <p>In terms of modeling, German tanks are always the favorite of modelers. While not as customizable in terms of stowage as the American tanks, the Germans used a wide variety of camouflage on their tanks, with many surviving photos used as inspiration. The Germans also applied a paste to their tanks called zimmeret, which was an anit-tank mine paste, that was applied in late 1943. This provides even more customization for modelers tanks, but historically accurate tanks in the inter-war period will most always have this paste, which can sometimes be a paint to recreate using putty. In regards to painting of the tank, the Wehrmacht kept a unqiue log of what types of paints they used on their tanks, so modern companies have replicated this, unlike the Sherman tank, which was just painted in a color called Olive drab, which varies today from a dark tannish color, to a mottled green color. The standard German colors had labels and codes. The painting and building of the Tiger can be a bit more complicated if someone wants to recreate the tank in a historical setting. There were multiple columns of roadwheels on the tank, unlike the sherman, which just had a single column of wheels. These can be a pain to paint if someone has already put them on the tank, similar to how hard it was back in 1943 to remove wheels and fix them due to their incredible complexity. To this day, the Tiger and the Tiger II are the most famous tanks that modelers build, and are arguably the most commonly bought. In terms of size, the tank at 1/35th scale is around 24cm long and 10 cm wide. </p>

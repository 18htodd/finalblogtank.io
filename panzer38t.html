        <h2>Design and Description</h2>
        <p> The Panzer 38t is definitely an interesting little tank. It only holds a 4 man crew, in comparison to the other tanks on this page, which are all 5 man crew, which is standard. The tank was a lightly armored tank with a 37mm cannon, standard for the era right before the start of the war. The tank was better than those in the German Army before the start of the second world war, so production of the tank continued after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in 1938-1939. The tank was a very well made tank, but its small size limited the amount of modification that could be done to the tank after the war had started, for example, a larger gun and added-on armor.  </p>

            <h2>Panzer 38t in Action and 1/35 Panzer T's</h2>
<p>The first Ausf.As saw action in Poland with the 3rd Leichte Division. In Norway, they formed a large part of the XXXI Armee Korps. In France, they were engaged mainly with various units of the 6, 7 and 8th Panzerdivions, and later with the latter unit in the Balkans, April-May 1941. But the real test came with Operation Barbarossa, were they equipped the 6th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 19th and 20th Panzer Division. It was clear by 1942 that their capabilities were limited in regular combat, and they were more and more relegated to pure reconnaissance missions and rearguard actions. The chassis however proved very versatile, and the Wehrmacht used the chassis for a variety of Tank-Destroyers and SPG's. The most famous being the Jagdpanzer 38, or the Hetzer, of which close to 3,000 were built, surpassing the original tank it was based on. This small tank-destroyers saw action in 1944-1945, but by that point, Soviet manpower and tank production far outweighed anything the Wehrmacht could must up, and the tank was fairly limited in its power to do its job. </p>

<p>The Hetzer is a common and popular tank for modelers, but the 38t is quite small, and this can lead to some issues, as these tanks at the 1/35th scale are about half the size of a Sherman, if not smaller. Most of these tanks were in the standard panzer grey. Late war tanks could be found in certain camouflages, but most remained in the grey. Like stated in the Tiger page, this is a great asset to modelers, as the color has been widely researched and most companies "panzer grey" are almost the same, unlike any of the Sherman colors, which can vary widely.  </p>

        <p>I build and paint scale models, and tanks are some of my favorite, so I figured I would share some cool facts about a few and maybe upload a few pictures of what I and others do.</p>

        <p>The M4 Sherman (named after the famous American Civil War general William T. Sherman) is one of the few really iconic
          fighting vehicles of the Allies during World War Two, and one of the most famous tanks in history. But while this historic
          status was gained partly thanks to its intrinsic qualities, but also due to the sheer numbers in which they were provided,
          only surpassed by the Soviet Union’s T-34, with a staggering 49,000 total delivered. It remains by far the most widely used
           tank on the Allied side during the war. It was derived into countless derivatives and had a very long postwar career which
           lasted well into the Cold War. It has been largely compared to the T-34, and had the occasion to confront some during the Korean War.</p>

        <h2><a href="tiger.html">Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf.E (Sd.Kfz.181) Tiger I</a></h2>
        <p>There is no other tank in AFV history which has captured the popular imagination more than the Panzerkampfwagen
          VI Tiger Sd.Kfz.181 of WW2. Nothing epitomises armored conflict to the general public like its massive structure
          on the battlefield. It is the one tank most people can name, even if they have little or no real interest in tanks.
From the early days of combat against this tank in WW2 until the present day, the fame of the Tiger spans, in equal amounts,
its real development history, combat performance, and fandom. It is a tank with many flaws and one whose mystique, even back in WW2,
 was out of all proportion to its utility and service as a combat vehicle. Yet, despite its flaws and problems, the tank remains a
 potent symbol of WW2 and, for many, it is the tank which served as their introduction to the world of armored fighting vehicles.</p>

      <h2><a href="merkava.html">Merkava</a></h2>
      <p>The Merkava was designed soon after the Yom Kippur War (1973). The Israelis initially wanted to acquire
        Chieftains from Great Britain, but the British Government decided in 1969 to cancel any weapon deliveries to Israel,
         and therefore the project was halted. This prompted the designing of a local tank, which would become the Merkava.
         The first prototype was ready in 1974, heavily drawing on lessons learned from the 1973 October War. In short,
          the Merkava was the embodiment of the ideal MBT for the army. Combining speed, endurance, firepower and accuracy
          with high survivability requirements and an emphasis put on crew protection.</p>

    <h2><a href="panzer38t.html">Panzerkampfwagen 38(t)</a></h2>
    <p>The Panzerkampfwagen 38(t), originally known as the ČKD LT vz. 38 was a tank designed during the 1930s,
      which saw extensive service during World War II. Developed in Czechoslovakia by ČKD, the type was adopted
      by Nazi Germany following the annexation of Czechoslovakia. With the German Army and other Axis forces,
      the type saw service in the invasions of Poland, France and the USSR. Due to its riveted design, the Panzer 38(t) was a conventional inter-war tank design,</p>

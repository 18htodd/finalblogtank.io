        <h2>When did it start.</h2>

        <p>I started scale modeling when I was nine or ten, but not religiously or very often. My grandfather had built balsa wood planes when he was young, so he wanted to introduce me to something very similar. Hobby Lobby and Michaels, two stores that are common where I am from, have a lot of models, and he picked up a sherman for us to build together. We ended up never finishing it, but by middle school, I was wondering what happened to it. I then found it again and ended up finishing the tank, and realized I wanted to see what other one's I could do. This is where it all started, and I have been doing this models ever since. </p>

        <h2>Why do I do it</h2>
        <p>To me, its like a kind of art. Others might paint on canvas, or draw pictures, but I enjoy building, and then painting what I build. So to me, these models are like a unique type of art. In our busy world that we all live in today, painting these tanks and the tiny parts that come with them is relaxing, and really slows down the day, because it truly takes patience to sit down, get out glue or paint, and figure out what you want to do. I love to work with my hands, and building and painting these allows me to do this in a way that I always can, I don't have to be building great things, just small things. </p>

      <p>I have probably built and painted around 25 or 30 tanks, some of which I no longer have. I have done a few planes, but found that I love to do AFV's more. Its been an amazing thing to learn to do, because like all types of art, there is a learning curve from lumping globs of paint onto plastic, to getting all the details and mud and tool look like they would in real life. I used to hand paint all my models, and still do for many parts, but most modelers who model frequently use an Airbrush, which is an expensive little piece of machinery. Essentially, an airbrush is a much finer and customizable form of spray paint. Think of someone detailing your car paint, but with a much smaller tool, and with a "car" thats the size of their hand. </p>

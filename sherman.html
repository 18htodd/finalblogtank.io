        <h2>Design and Description</h2>
        <p>I'll try my best not to bore anyone with extraneous details, but I will talk about size, armor, and maybe armament. Regardless, the Sherman was the most widely used tank of the western allies, with many being sent to Britain and the Soviet Union. Design started before the war, but the tank did not enter action until late 1942 in North Africa. In terms of details, the tank weighed --based on different variants-- 33.4-42 tons, was around 20 feet long and 9 feet tall and wide. The frontal armor was up to 3 inches thick at the front, while some variants had extra armor added to the front. The standard armament was a short 75mm gun. The video at the top shows an experimental Sherman armed with rockets, called the Calliope. All of these details were fairly standard for a medium tank of the 1940-1943 time period.   </p>

            <h2>Sherman in Action & 1/35th Shermans</h2>
<p>As General Patton himself summarized: “In mechanical endurance and ease of maintenance our tanks are infinitely superior to any other”. This was especially true compared to the Tigers and Panthers which had a high consumption, requiring careful maintenance and limited cross-bridges capabilities.
The sherman was the typical American response to a problem. Its predecesor was poorly made and lacked a real turret, but the Sherman solved many of those problems, before becoming inadequate itself. Just under 50,000 were built, whereas the German produced only 1,350 Tiger I tanks. The Sherman was cheap, fairly lightweight --it needed to be shipped overseas-- and was a jack of all trades. Despite being designed in 1941, the Sherman was still in service in many countries as far as the fall of the iron curtain in 1990, leaving the strange impression of a “living fossil”. This could be found in the many improvements performed on its chassis, a testimony to its sturdiness and adaptability, and the huge supplies of spare parts available due to an early standardization and unrivaled, at least in the West, mass production. The “Easy Eight” was the blueprint for some improvements and late wartime versions that fought under the US flag during the Korean war and later the Vietnam war, under South Vietnamese flag. The Israeli completely modernized the type, later known as the M51 “Super Sherman”, which performed well during the 1967 and 1973 wars.</p>

<p>In terms of building and painting shermans, the most amazing part is their versatility. Due to the customization that crews would due in the field, modelers can likewise add numerous amounts of add-ons and cargo to their models. Most Shermans were painted in what was called olive drab, which to this day, we're not 100% sure what that looks like. There are a dozen companies that produced paints that modelers would use for the Sherman, but each olive drab is a bit different. Building the Shermans are always really easy, due to the simplicity of the actual tank, nothing is overly complicated, unlike most of the German tanks of the time. At a scale of 1/35, a built tank would be around 21cm long, 8.5cm wide, and 8.5cm tall. Which if you measure out, is fairly small, maybe the size of your hand. Another amazing part of building Shermans is the vast amount of variants there are, and each of these can be recreated, meaning almost no two shermans created by someone like me is alike. </p>

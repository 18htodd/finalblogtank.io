        <h2>Design and Description</h2>
        <p>The Merkava is the current Main Battle Tank, or MBT of the Israeli Defense Forces. Design criteria include rapid repair of battle damage, survivability, cost-effectiveness and off-road performance. The tank is unique in the fact that the engine is in front, the turret is in back, and there is actually a section of the tank where soldiers can ride protected in the back. All in all, this allows to tank to be an AFV, forward control and command station, medical disembarkation vehicle, and armored troop carrier, all at the same time! Like stated on the main page, the IDF was going to purchase British tanks and reverse engineer their own, but this fell thorugh when Britain was forced to stop supplying the IDF by other powers in the area. After the war in 1973, the IDF began using the lessons they learned in combat to reflect their ideal tank.   </p>

            <h2>Merkava in Action and 1/35th Merkavas</h2>
<p>As it came into production the Camp David peace treaty seemed to settle the territorial dispute and the lack of immediate threats from Syria, Jordan and Egypt allowed some relief of tensions. But soon the Abu Nidal Organization assassination urged the IDF to invade Southern Lebanon, both to deal with PLO active cells and with Syrian influence over the area. Centurion and older models then formed the bulk of the armored forces, but the Merkava made its debuts and immediately outperformed the T-62.
The war ended in May 1983 and led Tsahal to increase its tank survivability in urban warfare, but shifted into a border conflict which lasted until 1985, after a progressive withdrawal. Latest modifications proved it was immune to the RPG-7 and, most importantly, to the AT-3 Sagger. Later, they were engaged during the Second Intifada (2002) and the 2006 Lebanon War, dealing with the Hezbollah, now armed with a great array of modern AT equipment (over 1000 missiles were fired at Merkava tanks).
The war left 5 tanks destroyed (two Mk. IV) and 40 damaged, but later salvaged and repaired. The Russian AT-14 “Kornet” proved the most lethal against Mk. II/III models, but Tsahal declared it was satisfied by the Mk. IV performances. The casualty number after tank penetration remained low, an average 2 to 1.5. This was confirmed during the Gaza War, with no casualty so far, mostly the result of revised tactics and better training for asymmetric warfare. Furthermore, since 2010, the Trophy active protection system is being introduced gradually to improve the Mk. IV survivability against the most advanced HEAT missiles, which was proven on March 1st, 2011 near the Gaza border.</p>
<p>The Merkava that I built and painted is the sole modern tank that I have made, and boy is it different than all the others. Its size is quite impressive in comparison to the Sherman and 38t, while its a bit bigger than the Tiger tank, which was a massive tank for its time. The scary thing is, the Merkava would be considered a small MBT, at least when compared to the German Leopard and U.S Abrams. The paint schemes are either a greyish tan color, or a greyish green color, depending on the sources. The nice things about modern tanks is that there is a lot more info that is readily available to someone searching for information on the internet, while details on WW2 tanks, for comparison, can be much harder to find. In the 1/35th scale, the tank is 21.6cm long, 10cm wide, and about 7.6cm tall.  </p>
